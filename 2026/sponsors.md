## Why Sponsor?

The Applied Machine Learning Conference brings together practitioners, researchers, and leaders at the forefront of AI and data science. By sponsoring the 2026 Applied Machine Learning Conference, your organization gains direct access to a concentrated community of AI engineers, data scientists, computational researchers, and technical decision-makers from across the Mid-Atlantic region and beyond. Whether you're recruiting top talent, launching new tools and platforms, or building brand awareness in the AI space, the AMLC provides focused opportunities to connect with professionals and researchers who are actively building and deploying AI and machine learning systems.

**We are an independent, community-organized conference. Sponsors are essential partners in making the event possible.** Your sponsorship directly enables us to bring together a diverse range of attendees, from startup founders to enterprise architects, from academic researchers to industry experts. By supporting the Applied Machine Learning Conference, your brand gains authentic association with a growing hub of ML and AI expertise during one of the most dynamic periods in the field's history.
