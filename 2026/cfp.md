# Call for Proposals

The Call for Proposals for the 2026 Applied Machine Learning Conference will open soon. We are seeking proposals for 40-minute talks and 90-minute tutorials that share knowledge, insights, and practical experience in data science, AI, machine learning, and related fields.

**Speakers will receive a free ticket for the entire event.** **All presentations will be given live and in-person.** **Please note that speakers are responsible for providing their own travel and lodging accommodations.**

Talks are 40-minute presentations, including time for audience Q&A. They often include slides and demos, and tend to feature less audience interaction than tutorials. All talks will be delivered on the first day, Friday, April 17, at the Violet Crown Cinema in downtown Charlottesville.

## Tutorials: Saturday, April 18

Tutorials are longer 90-minute sessions that more closely resemble a classroom setting. They tend to dive deeper into how to use a particular tool, technique, framework, modeling methodology used by modern data science and AI researchers and practitioners. They usually offer more opportunities for audience interaction, such as live demonstrations, coding along, or hands-on exercises.

All tutorials will be delievered on the second day, Saturday, April 18, at the University of Virginia School of Data Science.
